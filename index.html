	<h2>Plot</h2>
		<p>In 1945 New York City, it is the wedding day of Connie, the only daughter of the organized crime family's leader, Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito also has three sons, Sonny, Fredo, and Michael who has just returned from his service in WW2 with the Marines accompanied by his girlfriend, Kay Adams. Don Vito also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen, who works as his consigliere, which is an Italian term for an advisor to the family business. During the wedding day, Johnny Fontane, a famous singer, seeks help from Don Vito to land a role in a new movie but is being denied by studio head, Jack Woltz. Unable to refuse a favor from Don Vito on the day of any Don's daughter's wedding day, Don Vito sends Tom Hagen to California to persuade Jack to reconsider. When Jack Woltz refuses and insults Don Vito, Jack wakes up the next morning the head of his prized horse lying in his bed.

		Don Vito's new concern involves Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, who wants to discuss a trade of narcotics to sell to the Corleones. However, Don Vito refuses in order avoid conflict with his political connections. Suspicios, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to talk with Sollozzo and his men about joining him and leaving the Corleone family. Seeing right through his lie, Sollozzo has Luca killed on the spot. He then orders a hit on Don Vito who is shot several times and has Tom Hagen kidnapped. Hagen is convinced by Sollozzo that Vito is dead and sends him off to reconsider the deal to Sonny, who is now in charge of the family business. We then learn that Vito has survived his attack and is being treated in a hospital. When Michael goes to visit his father he finds there are no gaurds and must fend off another assassination attempt with a neighnorhood friend by posing as guards at the front. Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's bodygaurd, arrives immediately to confront Michael, breaking his jaw. In retaliation of Michael, Sonny kills Tattaglia's son. When Vito returns home, the Corleone's discuss their next move. Michael creates the idea to kill both Sollozzo and McCluskey during the meeting to discuss a peace treaty at a restaurant in the Bronx. There, Michael kills them both with a planted gun in the bathroom.

		War has erupted between the Five Families while Michael has escaped to take refuge in Sicily and Fredo in Las Vegas under the supervision of casino giant, Moe Green. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries, Apollonia Vitelli. Shortly after, Michael learns of the death of his brother Sonny, who was gunned downed at a toll booth when making his way to kill Carlo, Connie's husband, who has beaten and abused her several times. After learning this news, his wife dies in an assissination attempt meant for Michael by one of his body gaurds. Knowing it is no longer safe in Sicily, Michael returns home to take over the family business with the blessing of his father. 

		As the new Don, Michael decides to see his brother in Vegas and talk to Moe Greene about buying him out. Insulted, Moe Greene denies, claiming that the Corleone family are weak and being run out by the other families. After Michael returns home, Vito dies of a heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, a corleone capo, tells Michael that Barzini wants to discuss a peace. Doing so, Tessio reveals himself as the traitor that Vito warned him about. Michael sets the meeting the same day as the christening of Connie's baby to be Godfather. During this, Michael order hits on all heads of the five families and Moe Greene. Later that day, Michael has Carlo confess who he set the hit for Sonny with, revealing that it was indeed Barzini. Clemenza then has Carlo strangled in a car. 

		Days later, Connie confronts Michael about Carlo, accusing him of his death. Kay enters as Connie is in a fit of hysteria telling Kay that Michael was responsible. When Kay asks if it is true, Michael denies, leaving Kay relieved. Capos then enter Michael's office and we see a final cut to Kay's worried face as the door is closed in front of her.</p>

	<p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather#Critical_response">Wiki page</a> has a lot of great qualities that my site doesn't. A few things are that almost every important name or title has a link leading to more information about it. Since the page holds so much information on one page, there's a directory near the top to lead you to where you want to go. Also, there is a huge list of references if the information on its own page wasn't enough. Some code on here that I don't recognize are the "audio" tag which I imagine provides a link to an audio clip, the "i" tag which seems like it takes you to the previous location of the text in the same page, and finally the "caption" tag which titles the tables. I then used it in my own to better explain my own tables.</p>
